Technical FAQ:

1. Q: When starting a simulation job, the GUI program generates "Connect to
      Dispatcher at X.X.X.X Failed" error message.

   A: Before you submit a simulation job to the dispatcher,
      you should let your GUI program know the IP address and port
      number used by the dispatcher. This can be configured by executing
      the Setting -> Dispatcher command in the GUI program. For the
      single-machine mode, the IP address can be set to 127.0.0.1 or
      your machine's IP address, the port number should be set to the
      default port number 9,800, and the username and password should be
      set to the username and password of the user on this local machine.
      It is important that the user name entered here should not be "root,"
      otherwise, the command console function cannot work correctly.

2. Q: When starting a simulation job, the GUI program generates "No Idle
      Server" error message.

   A: This means that currently no coordinator program is running up and
      connected to the dispatcher program. If an idle coordinator program
      is up but this error message still appears, something may have gone 
      wrong. In such a situation, the best way to handle this problem is 
      to simply kill the dispatcher, coordinator, and the GUI programs, 
      and restart all of them. 

3.  Q: Where can I find some pre-built example simulation cases to start with?

    A: There are several example simulation cases stored in the "examples"
       directory in the package. You can run them by opening their .tpl files 
       in the GUI program. 

4.  Q: Do you have some demo video clips showing the operations and capability
       of this simulator?

    A: Some demo video clips are stored at the NCTUns web site at 
       http://NSL.csie.nctu.edu.tw/nctuns.html. Since their sizes are huge, 
       they are not included in this package.

5.  Q: What can I do if the GUI program (nctunsclient) crashes every time
       when I launch it on my computer?

    A: You can copy nctunsclient.bin in NCTUns-6.0/gui/ of the NCTUns package 
       to /usr/local/nctuns/bin. If this does not solve the problem, you can 
       use "yum update" to update your system and this should be able to 
       solve the problem. If this problem still happens after updating your 
       system, you can visit the NCTUns forum at 
       http://nsl10.cs.nctu.edu.tw/phpBB/ and report this problem to us.
