We have used a screen-capturing program to capture the on-screen operations 
of NCTUns and recorded them as .avi demo video clips. These demo video 
files can be played on Windows operating systems or Linux operating systems. 

Watching these demo video clips help you quickly get a feel of 
NCTUns and easily learn how to operate it. Although these demo 
video files are very helpful, we do not include them in the package 
due to their huge sizes. The reason is that not all Internet users 
have broadband network access to download a huge package. As such,
we purposely do not include these demo video files in this package.

If you are interested in watching these demo video clips, please visit
the web site of NCTUns at http://NSL.csie.nctu.edu.tw/nctuns.html
to download them.
