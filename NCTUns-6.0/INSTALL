I. REQUIREMENT

    1. OS Platform: Fedora 11 Linux (with gcc compiler installed)
    2. X window system (GNOME/KDE window manager is recommended.)
    3. Root privilege
    4. bash/tcsh assigned as the user's login shell (for command console 
       function)

    NOTE: You must be the root user to successfully run install.sh!

II. Run install.sh

    In the shell, you can run the script program by the following command:

    ./install.sh

    The install.sh program will ask you several questions during the
    installation. For a normal installation, you can simply answer "Yes" or 
    "Y" to all of these questions.

    It will take a few minutes to finish the installation.
    The programs in the package will be installed in /usr/local/nctuns 
    by default. You may use "install.sh -h" to see more information.
   
III. Then you should reboot your system to use the newly-built kernel.
     When the Linux boot loader asks you to choose a kernel to boot,
     you should choose the new kernel, which has "NCTUns" as its name.

IV.  When the machine is up again, the installation is done.
